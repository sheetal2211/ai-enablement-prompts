# Steps to Generate copilot-instructions.md

This file outlines the stepwise process for generating a comprehensive `copilot-instructions.md` with four key sections: Context, General Guidelines, File Structure and Patterns, and Contribution Guidelines. Follow these steps to ensure consistency and completeness.

---

## 1. Context
- Analyze the codebase to identify:
  - Technology stack (languages, frameworks, libraries)
  - Build tools
  - Architectural patterns
  - Coding style and conventions
- Summarize findings in a concise "Context" section.

## 2. General Guidelines
- Based on the context, provide general coding and architectural guidelines.
- Include best practices, conventions, and any project-specific rules.
- Address code readability, testability, and maintainability.

## 3. File Structure and Patterns
- Map out the project’s file and folder structure.
- Describe the purpose of each major directory/module.
- Document patterns to follow and patterns to avoid for each module.
- Include naming conventions and organization principles.

## 4. Contribution Guidelines
- Summarize the process for contributing to the project.
- Include:
  - Commit message conventions
  - Branch naming rules
  - Pull request requirements
  - Testing and review expectations
- Reference any automation or CI requirements.

## Execution Instructions
1. Review the codebase and extract the required information for each section.
2. Draft each section based on your findings and the structure above.
3. Combine all sections into a single `copilot-instructions.md` file.
4. Place the file at `/.github/copilot-instructions.md` in your repository.

This process ensures your instructions file is comprehensive, actionable, and tailored to your project’s actual structure and standards.
